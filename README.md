#  Operation Sound Sentinel

> **An AI-powered acoustic monitoring system to detect and prevent wildlife poaching using MLOps pipelines and real-time sound analysis.**

---

##  Overview

**Operation Sound Sentinel** is a full **end-to-end MLOps project** that listens to the sounds of the jungle through **IoT microphones**.  
The system uses **machine learning** to detect suspicious sounds — such as **gunshots** or **vehicle noise** — and instantly notifies wildlife rangers.

The goal is to **protect animals**, **assist conservation teams**, and demonstrate how **AI + Cloud + Edge computing** can work together to solve real-world problems.

---

##  Key Objectives

-  Build a robust audio pipeline for jungle sound ingestion.  
-  Train deep learning models for acoustic event detection.  
-  Deploy the model to AWS (cloud)  
-  Monitor model performance, drift, and retraining automatically.  
-  Deliver actionable alerts to rangers in real time.
