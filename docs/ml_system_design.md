# Operation Sound Sentinel - ML System Design

## 1. Overview

Operation Sound Sentinel is an AI-driven acoustic surveillance system that detects gunshots and vehicle sounds in protected forests. It combines edge AI devices, cloud processing, and MLOps tools for continuous monitoring, training, and deployment.

## 2. Architecture Summary

* **Edge Layer:** Microphones and Raspberry Pi devices capture and preprocess sounds. Audio is converted into Mel-spectrograms and sent to Kafka.
* **Data Layer:** Kafka streams audio to cloud storage (S3 or MinIO). Data versioning is handled with DVC.
* **Model Layer:** Models are trained using PyTorch or TensorFlow. MLflow tracks experiments and parameters.
* **Serving Layer:** Trained models are deployed via FastAPI or TorchServe. Predictions are logged for monitoring.
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus collects metrics; Grafana visualizes dashboards. Alerts trigger if performance drops.

## 3. Core Components

* **Data Ingestion:** Kafka, Airflow
* **Feature Extraction:** Librosa, NumPy
* **Model Training:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* **Model Tracking:** MLflow, DVC
* **Deployment:** Docker, FastAPI
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

## 4. Workflow

1. Edge devices record and preprocess audio.
2. Features are extracted and streamed to Kafka.
3. Data is stored, versioned, and prepared for training.
4. Models are trained and registered in MLflow.
5. Best model is deployed via Docker container.
6. Metrics are monitored for drift and degradation.

## 5. Tools & Environment

* **Languages:** Python
* **Cloud:** AWS or Local Linux server
* **Version Control:** Git + DVC
* **Containerization:** Docker

## 6. Next Steps

* Finalize dataset preprocessing.
* Build first baseline model.
* Configure MLflow tracking.
* Containerize model service with FastAPI.
* Add Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection.
