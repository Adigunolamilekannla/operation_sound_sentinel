# Operation Sound Sentinel - Project Plan

## 1. Objective
Develop an AI-powered acoustic surveillance system to detect gunshots  in protected forest zones using edge devices and machine learning.

## 2. Goals
- Build an end-to-end ML pipeline from data ingestion to deployment.
- Enable real-time detection and alerting.
- Achieve over 90% detection accuracy with minimal false positives.
- Automate retraining and monitoring using MLOps practices.

## 3. Deliverables
- Audio data preprocessing pipeline (Mel-spectrogram extraction).
- Trained classification model.
- Model tracking and versioning setup with MLflow and DVC.
- Containerized inference API with FastAPI.
- Monitoring dashboard using Prometheus and Grafana.
